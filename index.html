<h1>Sophia (age 8), Anna (age 10) and Diana(age 8) NASA Space Apps Challenge Project 2023</h1>
  <h2> Challenge: Visualize a Space Mission Using Virtual Reality </h2>
<ol>
  <li>We prepared by installing GMAT on the laptop</li>
  <li>At the challenge we followed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0anA2qy7Yu8&list=PLu-enCkOiXs-4JI4poX5TsbCQcw1qQF5Q&index=4> tutorial for GMAT </a> the trajectory . This step required a lot of concentration which some of us didn not have till the end</li>
  <li>We produced two script files with our trajectory one done by Anna fully and one done by Sophia with help of mum to finish</li>
  <li>We didn't manage to do more with VR visualization but we played with the VR set</li>
</ol>
